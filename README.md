# Simple-Age-Calculator
This project is a straightforward tool that calculator doesn't just tell you how old you are in years. 
It gives you a complete breakdown of how much time has passed since you were born.
You just enter your birthday, and it’ll show your age in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and even seconds! It’s a fun and easy way to see exactly how long you've been alive.
